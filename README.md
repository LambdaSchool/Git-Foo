# This is a Test Repo for learning about Git & Pair Programming

## For pair programming “collaboration” with GitHub
1. Person A forks the Lambda School repository.
2. Person A adds person B as a Collaborator.
3. Person B accepts invite.
4. Both clone person A’s repository to their computers, for example:
    ```console
    $ git clone clone https://github.com/Person-A/Git-Foo.git
        Cloning into 'Git-Foo'...
        remote: Counting objects: 330, done.
        remote: Compressing objects: 100% (138/138), done.
        remote: Total 330 (delta 83), reused 171 (delta 56), pack-reused 124
        Receiving objects: 100% (330/330), 1.31 MiB | 1.25 MiB/s, done.
        Resolving deltas: 100% (126/126), done.
    ```
5. Work together, switch coding roles every half hour.
6. Upon the first switch<sup>*</sup>, save all changes, and commit them in your local Git repository
7. Push the commits to person A's GitHub repository
8. Make a Pull Request to Lambda School from person A's GitHub repository.
9. Person B pulls in the commits from Person A's GitHub repository.
10. Push and pull changes as you switch.
11. Commit often!
12. Attend the end of day stand up meeting.

##### <sup>*</sup> You are welcome to make a Pull Request upon the first commit of any change you make to the project. While a Pull Request is "open" any subsequent commits which get pushed to your GitHub repository will be automatically added to the open PR.
